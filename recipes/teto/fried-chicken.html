    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This fried chicken variant holds a special place in my kitchen because it’s unmistakably Teto’s favorite. Every time it appears on a menu, her reaction is the same, instant excitement, followed by an immediate order without hesitation. It’s that memorable.</p>
    <p>What makes this dish stand out is its bold balance: unapologetically hot and spicy, yet deeply savory from a carefully layered blend of spices. The heat is assertive but never overwhelming, allowing the aromatic seasoning to shine through. Each piece is fried to lock in moisture, so the chicken stays irresistibly juicy beneath its crisp, spice-packed coating.</p>
    <p>This recipe isn’t just about heat; it’s about flavor confidence. It’s the kind of fried chicken that leaves a lasting impression, the kind you crave again the moment the plate is empty and the kind that has earned a permanent spot among our most-requested favorites.</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>Here's the instructions for making this Nashville Hot Chicken</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare The Brine:</strong>Place the water, vinegar, salt, sugar, coriander seed, bay leaf, peppercorns, mustard seed and thyme into a small saucepot, set over medium high heat and stir until the salt and sugar have dissolved. Set aside to cool to room temperature. Strain the brine through a fine mesh strainer and refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Place the chicken pieces in to a 1-gallon ziptop bag, add the brine and seal. Place the bag into a large bowl and refrigerate 30 minutes. </li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the brine, rinse under cold water and pat dry. Place the chicken on a sheet tray lined with a cooling rack and refrigerate uncovered, for at least 2 hours and up to overnight so the chicken dries completely.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare The Hot Dip:</strong>Place the red pepper flakes in a small saucepan and cover with the oil. Set over medium high heat and bring to 165°F. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool slightly. Add the chili powder, salt and cayenne pepper and stir to combine. Set aside until ready to use or store in an airtight container, at room temperature for up to 2 weeks.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare The Barbecue Sauce:</strong>Place the mayonnaise, sugar, cider vinegar, water, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, hot sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, salt and black pepper into a medium bowl and whisk to combine. Refrigerate in an airtight container until ready to use and up to 2 weeks.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare The Chicken:</strong>Place 1 1/2 -inches of oil into a large, heavy pot or Dutch oven, set over medium high heat and bring to 325°F. (Or heat a deep fryer to 325°F, per the fryers instructions.)</li>
        <li>Place the buttermilk and eggs into a large bowl and whisk to combine.</li>
        <li>Place the flour, milk powder, garlic powder, 2 tablespoons of Spicewalla x Billy D's Fried Chicken Spice, and ½ teaspoon of kosher salt in a medium bowl and whisk to combine.</li>
        <li>Season the chicken on all sides with the remaining seasoning blend. Place the chicken, once piece at a time, in the flour mixture and turn to evenly coat. Shake off excess and return to the rack inside the sheet tray. </li>
        <li>Transfer all the chicken to the bowl with the buttermilk and egg mixture.</li>
        <li>Spoon ¼-cup of the buttermilk mixture into the flour mixture and using your fingertips, rub together until the texture is coarse like wet sand. One piece at a time, remove the chicken from the buttermilk, allowing access buttermilk to drip off. Place the chicken into the wet flour mixture and turn to coat well, pressing the mixture into the chicken to adhere as much of the flour on each piece as possible. Return the chicken to the prepared sheet tray and repeat until all the chicken has been coated.</li>
        <li>Prepare a clean sheet tray with a rack and set aside.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, carefully place 2 to 3 pieces of chicken at a time, into the hot oil and cook until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°F, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Carefully remove chicken from the fryer and place on the clean, prepared sheet tray and allow to drain. Repeat until all chicken is cooked.</li>
        <li>If desired, dip the chicken in the hot dip as soon as it comes out of the oil and then place on prepared sheet tray. Serve warm, with the barbecue sauce.</li>
