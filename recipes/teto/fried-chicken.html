    <h1>Nashville Hot Chicken</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This fried chicken variant holds a special place in my kitchen because it’s unmistakably Teto’s favorite. Every time it appears on a menu, her reaction is the same, instant excitement, followed by an immediate order without hesitation. It’s that memorable.</p>
    <p>What makes this dish stand out is its bold balance: unapologetically hot and spicy, yet deeply savory from a carefully layered blend of spices. The heat is assertive but never overwhelming, allowing the aromatic seasoning to shine through. Each piece is fried to lock in moisture, so the chicken stays irresistibly juicy beneath its crisp, spice-packed coating.</p>
    <p>This recipe isn’t just about heat; it’s about flavor confidence. It’s the kind of fried chicken that leaves a lasting impression, the kind you crave again the moment the plate is empty and the kind that has earned a permanent spot among our most-requested favorites.</p>
