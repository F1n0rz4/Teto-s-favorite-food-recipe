    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Few foods capture the spirit of France quite like the baguette crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, and lovingly present at breakfast tables across the country. It carries with it the comforting rhythm of French mornings, where the first break of the crust is almost as cherished as the taste itself.</p>
    <p>For Teto, the baguette holds an especially sweet place in her heart. She approaches each one with a kind of innocent joy, as though every loaf were a tiny gift waiting to be unwrapped. Sometimes she spreads just a hint of butter, other times a swirl of chocolate, creating her own little moment of delight. Watching her enjoy it is almost as pleasant as the bread itself a gentle reminder of how small, everyday pleasures can make life feel warmer, softer, and more charming.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 grams dry active yeast <em>(or about 2 teaspoons)</em></li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey <em>(natural honey worked better than the squeezable one)</em></li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups warm water <em>(not too hot - you don’t want to cook the yeast, just wake it up)</em></li>
        <li>2 ½ cups bread flour <em>(I used all purpose flour which also worked fine)</em></li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Tools</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A pastry scale <em>(definitely worth the $26 if you plan on baking a lot, but is not necessary for this recipe)</em></li>
        <li>a spatula</li>
        <li>a big mixing bowl</li>
        <li>measuring cups</li>
        <li>a baking sheet that supports high temperatures <em>(460 Degrees)</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>Now Let's begin to make this baguette</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Proof the yeast with the honey and warm water. For bread making novices, this means putting the warm water in a large bowl and adding the yeast and honey. Give it a little stir and then let it sit on the counter for 10 minutes. You will see the grains of yeast wake up and rise to the surface and expand. This is a cool process to share with kids!</li>
        <li>Once proofed, add salt and slowly add the flour and olive oil until a shaggy dough is formed. I started using a spatula and then dug in with my hands to work in all the flour. Form a round ball in the bowl but be careful not to work the dough too much.</li>
        <li>Dust the top of your dough ball with little bit of flour then cover with a towel. My Nanny’s trick was to wet a thin tea towel with hot water to cover the dough with and then place the bowl on top of the fridge. The motor gives off a little extra heat.</li>
        <li>Let the dough rise until it doubles in size (about an hour). Split dough in 2 and roll out your baguettes. </li>
        <li>Sprinkle flour over your countertop.</li>
        <li>Take the first ball of dough and gently knead it with the palm of your hand, until the dough gains a firmer consistency. Fold the dough over itself. Add a little more flour if necessary. <em>(this is necessary if you are baking in a place with high humidity- don't be afraid to add more dough if the consistency is sticky)</em></li>
        <li>Flatten the dough into a rectangle form with your hands (you don't need a rolling pin). Then fold the top of the rectangle down like the top of an envelop, about ¾ of the way down. Using your fingers, press down on the seam.</li>
        <li>Roll the folded top of the dough down so that you have a mini oblong rectangle. Press the seams and the flip the seam side down.</li>
        <li>Spread your fingers on both hands and gently roll the dough down to create a baguette shape. Roll back and forth to elongate the baguette dough until it is about 12 inches long.</li>
        <li>Set the first baguette on your cookie sheet </li>
        <li>If you have a razor blade you can make incisions on the top of the baguette. A sharp knife also works using just the tip to make deft cuts into the baguette.</li>
        <li>Place the baguettes on a cookie sheet sprinkled with flour and then sprinkle a little more flour on top. Sprinkle a little fleur de sel. Let baguettes rise for another 30 minutes (uncovered) while oven preheats.</li>
        <li>Heat oven to 460 degrees. Once the oven is hot, fill a 9 inch pan halfway with water. Place on the bottom rack of the oven. The water pan creates steam and and is the key factor to that crackly crust we love and soft chewy bread interior.</li>
        <li>Place the cookie sheet or baguette pan on the middle rack of the hot oven. If you have a baking stone, let it heat up completely in the oven before placing your baguettes directly on the stone.</li>
        <li>Bake for 25 minutes <em>(Remove the pan of water (very carefully!) and bake another 5 minutes or so. The baguettes should be beautifully golden brown and sound hollow when tapped.)</em></li>
    </ol>
