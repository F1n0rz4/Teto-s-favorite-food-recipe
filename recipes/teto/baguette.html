    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Few foods capture the spirit of France quite like the baguette crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, and lovingly present at breakfast tables across the country. It carries with it the comforting rhythm of French mornings, where the first break of the crust is almost as cherished as the taste itself.</p>
    <p>For Teto, the baguette holds an especially sweet place in her heart. She approaches each one with a kind of innocent joy, as though every loaf were a tiny gift waiting to be unwrapped. Sometimes she spreads just a hint of butter, other times a swirl of chocolate, creating her own little moment of delight. Watching her enjoy it is almost as pleasant as the bread itself a gentle reminder of how small, everyday pleasures can make life feel warmer, softer, and more charming.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 grams dry active yeast <em>(or about 2 teaspoons)</em></li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey <em>(natural honey worked better than the squeezable one)</em></li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups warm water <em>(not too hot - you don’t want to cook the yeast, just wake it up)</em></li>
        <li>2 ½ cups bread flour <em>(I used all purpose flour which also worked fine)</em></li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Tools</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A pastry scale <em>(definitely worth the $26 if you plan on baking a lot, but is not necessary for this recipe)</em></li>
        <li>a spatula</li>
        <li>a big mixing bowl</li>
        <li>measuring cups</li>
        <li>a baking sheet that supports high temperatures <em>(460 Degrees)</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>Now Let's begin to make this baguette</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Proof the yeast with the honey and warm water. For bread making novices, this means putting the warm water in a large bowl and adding the yeast and honey. Give it a little stir and then let it sit on the counter for 10 minutes. You will see the grains of yeast wake up and rise to the surface and expand. This is a cool process to share with kids!</li>
    </ol>
