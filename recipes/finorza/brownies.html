    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Brownies have always been my go-to comfort treat. Every time I step into a bakery, my eyes immediately search for that perfect tray of rich, chocolatey goodness. There’s just something irresistible about the combination of a soft, tender crumb and a warm, gooey center that melts with every bite.
What makes brownies even better is how simple they are to create at home. With just a handful of basic ingredients, you can whip up a batch that tastes every bit as indulgent as the ones from your favorite bakery. This recipe captures everything I love about brownies, it's sweet, fudgy, and incredibly satisfying.
If you’re craving a dessert that’s easy, comforting, and guaranteed to impress, these brownies are the perfect choice.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>The ingredients is very simple and you can make it in your home</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p><strong>½ cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><strong>1 cup granulated sugar</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><strong>1 tsp vanilla extract</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><strong>2 large eggs</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><strong>½ cup all-purpose flour</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><strong>½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><strong>¼ tsp salt</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><strong>1 ½ cups chocolate chips (optional, for extra fudginess)</strong></p></li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>here's the simple instructions that you can follow</p>
    <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Preheat Oven & Prepare Pan:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Lightly grease a 9x9 inch metal baking pan and line it with parchment paper, leaving some overhang on the sides for easy removal later.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the slightly cooled melted butter, sugar, and vanilla extract until smooth. Whisk in the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Add Dry Ingredients:</strong> Stir in the flour, cocoa powder, and salt until just combined. Be careful not to overmix the batter; stop as soon as no dry streaks of flour are visible.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Fold in Chocolate Chips:</strong> Gently fold in the chocolate chips with a spatula if desired. The batter will be thick.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Bake:</strong> Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the edges are set and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Cool Completely:</strong> Place the pan on a wire rack and allow the brownies to cool completely before slicing. This is crucial for achieving a proper fudgy texture and clean cuts</p></li>
    </ol>
