    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Martabak Telur (often known as Indonesian egg-stuffed pancakes) is a must-try street-food classic that captures the heart of anyone who tastes it. This savory delight is generously filled with beaten eggs, minced meat, scallions, and aromatic spices, all wrapped in a thin, crispy pastry. Fried to golden perfection, each bite delivers a satisfying combination of crunch, richness, and warm, comforting flavor.
    If you’ve ever enjoyed Martabak Telur fresh from a street vendor, you know exactly why it’s so irresistible.

The acidity and crunch of the pickles balance the richness of the martabak, creating a flavor harmony that’s truly unforgettable.

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that the ingredients are prepared, it's time to make it</p>
    <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Prepare the dough:</strong>In a bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and salt. Gradually pour in the water while kneading until the dough becomes smooth and elastic.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Add oil:</strong>Add 2 tablespoons of cooking oil to the dough and continue kneading until it no longer feels sticky.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Rest the dough:</strong>Divide the dough into two portions and shape each into a ball. Place the dough balls in a bowl filled with oil, ensuring they are fully submerged. (The oil used for soaking the dough can be reused later for cooking other dishes.)</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Prepare the filling:</strong>Heat a small amount of cooking oil in a pan. Sauté the chopped onion and garlic until fragrant.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Cook the meat:</strong>Add the minced beef and cook until fully browned. Season with ground pepper, salt, and sugar. Add part of the sliced green onions, stir briefly, and cook until the onions soften. Remove from heat and drain.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Combine with eggs:</strong>In a separate bowl, lightly beat the eggs. Add the remaining green onions and the cooled cooked beef mixture. Mix until evenly combined.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Shape the dough:</strong>After soaking for about one hour, take one dough ball and flatten it using your hands or a rolling pin until thin and wide.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Cook the wrapper:</strong>Heat a small amount of oil in a large nonstick pan—just enough to coat the surface (avoid using too much oil that would submerge the dough). Carefully place the thin dough onto the hot pan.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Add the filling:</strong>Pour half of the prepared filling onto the center of the dough. Fold the top, bottom, left, and right sides over the filling, forming a neat rectangular parcel, similar to folding an envelope</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Fry until golden:</strong>Cook until the martabak skin turns golden and crispy. Flip to ensure both sides are evenly cooked.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Serve:</strong>Once fully cooked, remove from the pan and drain excess oil. Repeat the process with the remaining dough and filling.
        Serve your homemade Martabak Telur warm, accompanied by cucumber pickles (acar timun) and chopped bird’s-eye chilies for the perfect finishing touch.</p></li>
